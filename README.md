# Traffic Signal Optimization – Via Prenestina (Rome)

This project was developed as part of the **Traffic Engineering and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)** course at Sapienza University of Rome.

## 📌 Overview
The project analyzes traffic conditions at **4 signalized junctions on Via Prenestina, Rome**, using **Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodologies**. The objective was to optimize traffic signal settings to **reduce delays, improve Level of Service (LOS), and minimize emissions**.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Collect and analyze traffic flow data at four intersections.
- Apply **HCM procedures** to determine capacity, v/c ratios, and intersection delays.
- Design optimized **signal timings and synchronization** across the corridor.
- Evaluate LOS improvements and traffic efficiency.

## 🛠️ Methods
- **Highway Capacity Manual (HCM)** methodology (LOS & delay analysis).
- Lane grouping, saturation flow adjustment, and capacity calculations.
- Signal timing optimization (green, yellow, red phases).
- Bandwidth-based synchronization for arterial coordination.

## 🚀 Results
- Reduced average **intersection delay** and improved LOS across junctions.
- Synchronization plan increased **traffic progression efficiency**.
- Recommendations contribute to **smoother traffic flow and lower emissions**.
